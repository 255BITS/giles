Giles wants you to stop writing HTML, CSS, and JS. 

Giles is a static asset builder for a variety of useful markup languages.  Use Giles to develop with 
nextgen web tools and increase project momentum.

##Giles supports
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) - Incredible javascript compiler.  Everything just seems to work better with coffeescript. 
* [Stylus](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus) - Fantastic css compiler.  The variable/mixin support is extremely powerful.
* [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) - Cool HAML-like alternative to writing html.
* Your favorite language.  Add it and issue a pull request.

###Giles is a command line tool and API for:
* Developing.  Watch a directory using the `giles -s` command, and build files as they are requested.
* Releasing.  Building static assets for deployment 

The goal of Giles is not to advocate a specific framework, rather to provide developers and designers
functionality in the languages of their choice.

###To install run 

```bash
sudo npm install -g giles
```

_npm is available by installing [nodejs](http://nodejs.org)_

### To build static assets, recursively
```bash
giles
```

_It will build every file into the same directory(views/index.jade will become views/index.html)_

###To get help 
```bash
giles -h
```

_If you ever need to run this, file a bug with me._

<!--
###To watch the current directory, recursively 
    giles -w
_Handles new files too.  It will work even if you re-arrange your whole project._

###To watch a specific directory, recursively 
    giles directory -w
_This compiles to the same directory as the asset._
###To build all assets recursively, outputting to a specific directory 
    giles -o build
-->
###To ignore a directory, or multiple(will match recursively) 
```bash
giles --ignore vendor,bin
```

_ignore defaults to node_modules,.git_

###To start a webserver on port 9000
```bash
giles -s -p 9000
```
_-p is optional, and will default to 2255 if not specified_

###Environments are now supported.
Environments are shortcuts that allow you to treat compilations differently.  The built-in enviroments are dev and prod .
_giles defaults to development if nothing is specified._

```
giles <dir> -e prod
```

Compile assets in <directory> in production mode.
Jade assets (and all compiled types that support local variables) can contain tests for the environment:

```jade
- if(production)
  #prodOnly content
```

or

```jade
- if(environment == 'production')
  #prodOnly content
```

#API
These examples are in coffeescript.

### Building with .js and giles (works with Jake or Cake)

```coffeescript
srcDir = PATH_TO_SOURCE
options = {}

giles = require('giles')
giles.build(srcDir, options)
```

<!--
### To watch with giles 
    srcDir = PATH_TO_SOURCE
    options = {}

    giles = require('giles')
    giles.watch(srcDir, options)
-->

### To run the giles server

```coffeescript
giles = require('giles')
giles.server(dir, {port : 12345})
```

_Try it for a lightweight development mode_

### To use giles connect/express module
```coffeescript
connect.use(giles.connect(srcDir))
```

This connector will compile supported file types (index.jade will be compiled when index.html is requested).  It does not serve any files.

_It is imperative that you place this before `connect.static'_
  
### Adding a custom route
By default giles creates a 1-1 map of template to generated page.  This allows you to use the same jade file with separate variables
to generate a dynamic page that is built into a finite amount of static targets.

```coffeescript
#This generates static files with the output file dynamicPage.html
#locals is a list of variables available
#to the .jade file when running this action
locals = {name : "Martyn"}

giles.get '/dynamicPage.html', 'page.jade', locals
```

_Then in page.jade_
    
```jade
!!!
head
  title = name
```

### To add a compiler to giles
```coffeescript
coffee = require 'coffee-script'
giles.addCompiler ['.coffee', '.cs'], '.js', (contents, filename, output) ->
  output(coffee.compile(contents, {}))
```

#### Or for stylus
```coffeescript
stylus = require 'stylus'
giles.addCompiler [".styl", ".stylus"], '.css', (contents, filename, output) ->
  stylus.render contents, {filename: filename}, (err, css) ->
    if err
      console.error "Could not render stylus file: "+filename
      console.error err
    else
      output(css)
```

**Both of these compilers are already in giles and listed here for illustration purposes.**

#Changelog
### v0.5.3
* Added markdown
* Fixed a bug in coffeescript generation

### v0.5.2
* Added -v flag to output version number

### v0.5.1
* Added -e flag for environments
* Documentation slightly updated

### v0.5.0
* Added `giles.get("/route", sourceFile, locals)` for defining generated files
* Added -s option which tells giles to start a webserver on port 2255

###License
Giles is available under the MIT license.  We hope you find it useful.  Please let us at 255 BITS know if you use it for something cool.
