Giles is a project watcher and builder for a variety of useful markup languages.  Use Giles to develop with 
nextgen web tools.

Giles supports
* Jade
* Stylus
* CoffeeScript
* Your favorite language.  Add it and issue a pull request.


'giles' is a command line tool and API for:
* Watching a directory and building output files when source files change
* Building static assets for deployment


The goal of Giles is not to advocate a specific framework, rather to provide developers and designers
functionality in the language of their choice.  With Giles' lazy-loading approach, it only forces you to include
functionality that you use.
